# Audio streaming with Flask

This script is intended to demonstrate how to stream audio with flask.

Get internet audio stream with requests module and:
* re-stream
* real time transcode and stream directly from pipe

Execute: python app.py

requires:
-ffmpeg
-flask
-requests


reason: zararadio is an old software that does not support the reproduction of internet radios with modern stream formats. this serves as a temporary solution.
